[DAN]: So from your kind of {tag .community .leadership}`first entry point`, you know, where you first, you know, interacted with the community or interacted with the software itself and your trajectory kind of since then into the role that you're in now, which is this kind of leadership position.

00:26.969 --> 00:29.290
[MIN]: So JupyterHub specifically or Jupyter more broadly?

00:30.390 --> 00:33.433
[DAN]: Um, whichever you're more comfortable with more broadly would be awesome.

00:33.693 --> 00:39.177
[MIN]: But, um, you know, it was Jupiter hubs easy because I, I created it.

00:39.597 --> 00:46.403
[MIN]: So, um, so I started writing Jupiter hub as, so maybe we need to go further back.
